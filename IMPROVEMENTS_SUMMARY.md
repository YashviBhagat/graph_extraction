# Subgraph Extraction Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the subgraph extraction functionality in the Material Science Graph Extraction Website.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. **Extraction Boundaries**
**Problem**: Original extraction boundaries were too narrow, missing axis labels and captions.

**Solution**: 
- Increased expansion margins from 50px to 100px default
- Implemented asymmetric expansion (left: 150px, right: 100px, top: 80px, bottom: 120px)
- Added dynamic padding based on graph size (minimum 50px or 1/4 of dimensions)

### 2. **Axis Label Detection**
**Problem**: Poor detection of X and Y axis labels, often missing or incorrect.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced OCR configuration for scientific text
- Implemented 5 different detection methods:
  1. **Direct text search** with expanded label patterns
  2. **Region-based detection** with larger search areas
  3. **Unit pattern recognition** for common scientific units
  4. **Scientific term analysis** for axis indicators
  5. **Post-processing** to avoid duplicate labels

### 3. **Caption Generation**
**Problem**: Missing or incomplete captions for extracted subgraphs.

**Solution**:
- Created enhanced caption generation with detailed information
- Included source reference, axis labels, and original caption
- Added extraction metadata for traceability

### 4. **UI Display**
**Problem**: Axis labels and captions not properly displayed in the gallery.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced gallery template with styled caption and axis label sections
- Added visual indicators for detected vs. missing labels
- Improved layout with background colors and better spacing

## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Axis Label Detection
```python
# New features:
- Custom OCR configuration for scientific text
- Expanded label patterns (20+ X-axis, 20+ Y-axis labels)
- Region-specific detection (bottom for X-axis, left for Y-axis)
- Unit recognition (MPa, GPa, %, mm, etc.)
- Duplicate detection and differentiation
```

### Improved Graph Detection
```python
# Enhanced criteria:
- Increased minimum area (2000px vs 1000px)
- More flexible aspect ratios (0.3-4.0 vs 0.5-3.0)
- Compactness analysis for better shape detection
- Minimum dimension requirements (50x50px)
```

### Better Region Expansion
```python
# Asymmetric expansion:
- Left: 150px (Y-axis labels)
- Right: 100px (additional labels)
- Top: 80px (titles/headers)
- Bottom: 120px (X-axis labels)
```

## Test Results

### Axis Detection Accuracy
- **Before**: Often detected same label for both axes
- **After**: Proper differentiation between X and Y axes
- **Example**: "strain" vs "stress" instead of "strain" vs "strain"

### Subgraph Extraction
- **Before**: 1-2 subgraphs per image
- **After**: 4+ subgraphs detected with proper boundaries
- **Caption Quality**: Detailed captions with axis information

### File Generation
- ✓ Image files created with expanded boundaries
- ✓ Caption files with detailed information
- ✓ Axis labels properly detected and stored

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Upload PDFs** containing graphs with multiple subgraphs
2. **Navigate to Gallery** to view extracted graphs
3. **Right-click on any graph** and select "Extract Sub-Graphs"
4. **Review results** - extracted subgraphs will appear with:
   - Enhanced captions
   - Detected axis labels
   - Source reference information

### For Developers
1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Run tests**: `python test_complete_extraction.py`
3. **Start application**: `python app.py`

## API Endpoints

### Subgraph Extraction
```http
POST /extract_subgraphs
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "pdf_name": "Research_paper",
  "graph_filename": "graph_3_2.jpeg"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully extracted 4 subgraphs",
  "subgraphs": [
    {
      "filename": "graph_3_2_subgraph_1.jpeg",
      "path": "files/graphs/Research_paper/graph_3_2_subgraph_1.jpeg",
      "caption": "Subgraph 1 (extracted from graph_3_2). Axes: X-axis: Strain, Y-axis: Response...",
      "x_label": "strain",
      "y_label": "response"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Supported Axis Labels

### X-axis Labels
strain, time, temperature, displacement, elongation, extension, deformation, cycle, frequency, wavelength, energy, distance, position, angle, rotation, velocity, acceleration, force, load, pressure, volume, area, length, width, height

### Y-axis Labels
stress, load, force, modulus, strength, hardness, pressure, voltage, current, power, amplitude, intensity, strain, deformation, displacement, velocity, acceleration, temperature, energy, power, efficiency, density, mass

### Units Recognition
- **X-axis**: %, mm, μm, nm, s, min, hr, °C, K, deg, rad, m, cm
- **Y-axis**: MPa, GPa, N, kN, psi, ksi, V, A, W, J, kJ, cal, BTU

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Train models on scientific graph datasets
2. **Advanced OCR**: Use specialized scientific text recognition
3. **Graph Type Classification**: Identify different types of graphs (stress-strain, temperature-time, etc.)
4. **Interactive Selection**: Allow users to manually adjust extraction boundaries
5. **Batch Processing**: Extract subgraphs from multiple images simultaneously

## Files Modified

1. **process_pdfs.py**: Core extraction and detection algorithms
2. **app.py**: Flask routes and gallery data processing
3. **templates/gallery.html**: Enhanced UI display
4. **requirements.txt**: Updated dependencies
5. **test_*.py**: Comprehensive test scripts

## Performance Metrics
