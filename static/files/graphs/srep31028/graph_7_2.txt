Figure 8.  Engineering stress versus engineering strain for Al0.1CrCoFeNi at a strain rate of 1010 s−1. Stress under (a) compressive and (b) tensile load conditions at various temperatures – cryogenic (77 K), room temperature (300 K), and higher (700 K and 1,000 K). The tensile stress–strain diagram (b) shows only plastic deformation after the critical flow stress around 75 MPa for different temperatures, while the compressive stress-strain curve (a) shows the thermo-plastic instability leading to extended strain softening till a strain of 0.6%, followed by strain hardening.
